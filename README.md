# Personal Portfolio - Anwar Kader

This page contains everything you need to know about me, themed in LEGO as I like LEGO

The UI was designed with Google Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1Uc_bOXqGV_IrM-GaR90-0labFI1_pvEc

The application itself is run with React and Next.js, deployed through Vercel, and hosted on a Amazon Route 53 domain
